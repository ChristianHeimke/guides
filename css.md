# CSS guidelines

## Formatting

* Never ever use tabs to indent, always 2 spaces
* Indent continued lines 2 spaces
* One selector per line
* Use one space between property and value (`color: #000000`)
* Leave a blank line between rule sets
* Keep selectors as short and descriptive as possible
* Namespace common class name (`button-danger` over `danger`)

## Code

* Avoid duplication between selectors
* No inline CSS
* Don't use `#ids`
* Use hex color codes
* Always write the full hex code (`#000000` over `#000`)
* Use dashes to name classes (`span-1` over `span_1`)
