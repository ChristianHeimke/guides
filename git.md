# Git guidelines

* Prefix feature branch names with your initials
* Write a good, short commit message
* Add additional information to commit message below first one using an empty
  line to separate them
* Squash multiple commits into one before merging your feature branch into
  `master` to keep history clean and understandable
* Start commit message with uppercase character (`Initial commit` over `initial commit`)
* Don't use merge commits
* Create a tag for each released version
